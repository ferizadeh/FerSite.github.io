                <p>I'm a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> with a robust background in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. I specialize in predictive modeling and data visualization, transforming data into actionable insights. With a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and neural networks, I develop models that can make accurate predictions and uncover hidden patterns in data.</p>

                <p>My current research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to make AI models more transparent and understandable to humans. By enhancing the interpretability of AI systems, I strive to build trust and facilitate their integration into real-world applications.</p>

                <p>In addition to XAI, I have a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capabilities. My goal is to explore their potential in various domains, particularly in the biomedical field.</p>

                <p>I am passionate about the biomedical applications of AI, including medical data analysis, neuroimaging, and cancer research. By applying AI techniques to these areas, I aim to contribute to advancements in healthcare and improve patient outcomes.</p>
